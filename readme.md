# wordcount

The code file is in "hw1.py"

open it and choose the .txt you want to read in , on line 9
```console
for line in open('building_global_community.txt'):
```

And I use a variable "wordCounter" to catch the result of counter function to get the info in the .txt
```console
wordCounter = Counter(word_all)
```

Finally, I write the result out to a csv file "wordcount.csv"

As you can check in the file
